# Process_-_Thread

Introduction

The purpose of this project is to study how processes and threads are managed in a Linux environment.
The objectives of this project is to learn:
1. Get familiar with the Linux environment.
2. How to build a Linux kernel.
3. How to add a new system call in the Linux kernel.
4. How to obtain various information for a running process/thread from the Linux kernel.

Project submission
For each project, create a gzipped file containing the following items, and submit it through Blackboard.
1. A report that briefly describes how you solved the problems and what you have learned. For example,
you may want to make a typescript of the steps in building the Linux kernel; or the changes you made
in the Linux kernel source for adding a new system call.
2. The programming codes including both the kernel-level codes you added and the user-level testing
program.

Assignments
Assignment 0: Build the Linux kernel (20 points)
Step 1: Get the Linux kernel code
Before you download and compile the Linux kernel source, make sure you have development tools installed
on your system.

In CentOS, install these software using yum 1:
# yum install -y gcc ncurses-devel make wget
In Ubuntu, install these software using apt:
# apt install -y gcc libncurses5-dev make wget flex bison vim libssl-dev libelf-dev

Visit http://kernel.org and download the source code of your current running kernel. To obtain the
version of your current kernel, type:
$ uname -r
$ 2.6.32-220.el6.i686

The suffix i686 indicates that the kernel is 32 bit. A 64-bit kernel will show a suffix of x86_64.
Then, download kernel 2.6.32 and extract the source:
$ wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.32.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf linux-2.6.32.tar.gz

Note that you may not use the above link for kernel download as your kernel may be different (much newer)
than the kernel shown here. We will refer LINUX_SOURCE to the top directory of the kernel source.

Step 2: Configure your new kernel
Before compiling the new kernel, a .config file needs to be generated in the top directory of the kernel
source. To generate the config file and make possible changes to the default kernel configurations, type:
$ make menuconfig

No changes to the default configuration are needed at this time. Press ESC to exit the configuration menu
and a default config file will be generated.

Step 3: Compile the kernel
In LINUX_SOURCE, compile to create a compressed kernel image:
$ make -j4

Option -j4 will utilize four CPUs to accelerate the compilation.
To compile kernel modules:
$ make modules

Step 4: Install the kernel
Install kernel modules (become a root user, use the su command):
$ su -
# make modules_install

Install the kernel:
# make install

If you are using Ubuntu, you need to create an init ramdisk manually:
$ sudo mkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32
$ sudo update-initramfs -c -k 2.6.32

The kernel image and other related files have been installed into the /boot directory.

Step 5: Modify grub configuration file

1. If you are using CentOS:
Change the grub configuration file to boot from the newly installed kernel. Open file using vim:
# vim /boot/grub/menu.lst

The newly installed kernel should have a booting order 0, change the default kernel to 0:
default=0

IMPORTANT: In case that the new kernel fails to boot, we may want to select the old kernel from the VM
console. Set the timeout value (in seconds) to a large value (e.g., 25) to give yourself enough time to select.
timeout=25

2. If you are using Ubuntu:
Change the grub configuration file:
$ sudo vim /etc/default/grub
Make the following changes:
GRUB_DEFAULT=2
GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu
GRUB_TIMEOUT=25
Then, update the grub entry:
$ sudo update-grub2

Step 6: Reboot your VM
Reboot to the new kernel:
# reboot

After boot, check if you have the new kernel:
$ uname -r
$ 2.6.32

Assignment 1: Add a new system call into the Linux kernel (30 points)
In this assignment, we add a simple system call helloworld to the Linux kernel. The system call prints
out a hello world message to the syslog. You need to implement the system call in the kernel and write a
user-level program to test your new system call.

Step 1: Implement your system call Change your current working directory to the kernel source directory.
$ cd LINUX_SOURCE
Make a new directory my_sourceto contain your implementation:
$ mkdir my_source
Create a C file and implement your system call here:
$ touch my_source/sys_helloworld.c
Edit the source code to include the following implementation:
$ vim my_source/sys_helloworld.c

#include <l inux / k e rne l . h>
#include <l inux / s y s c a l l s . h>
SYSCALL_DEFINE0( he l l owo r ld )
{
  pr intk (KERN_EMERG "He l l o World ! \ n" ) ;
  return 1 ;
3
}

Add a Makefile to the my_source folder:
$ touch my_source/Makefile
$ vim my_source/Makefile
#
Makefile of the new system call
#
#
#obj-y := sys_helloworld.o

Modify the Makefile in the top directory to include the new system call in the kernel compilation:
$ vim Makefile

Find the line where core-y is defined and add the my_source directory to it:
core-y += kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ my_source/

32-bit Linux Add a function pointer to the new system call in arch/x86/kernel/syscall_table_32.S:
$ vim arch/x86/kernel/syscall_table_32.S

Add the following line to the end of this file:
.long sys_helloworld /* 337 */

Now you have defined helloworld as system call 337.

Register your system call with the kernel by editing arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_32.h. The last system
call in arch/x86/kernel/syscall_table_32.S has an id number 336, then our new system call should be
numbered as 337. Add this to the file unistd_32.h, right below the definition of system call 336:
#define __NR_helloworld 337

Modify the total number of system calls to 337 + 1 = 338:
#define NR_syscalls 338

Declare the system call routine. Add the following to the end of arch/x86/include/asm/syscall.h (right before
the line CONFIG_X86_32):

asmlinkage int sys_helloworld(void);

64-bit Linux Add the new system call to the system call table. Open the arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
file, and go to the part of the file right before the beginning of the "x32-specific system call numbers" , and
add the following after the rseq line:
$ 335 common helloworld __x64_sys_helloworld

Declare your new syscall in the header file include/linux/syscalls.h. Go to the bottom of the file and
add the following right before the #endif:
$ asmlinkage long sys_helloworld(void);

Repeat step 3 and 4 in assignment 0 to re-compile the kernel and reboot to the new kernel.

Step 2: Write a user-level program to test your system call
Go to your home directory and create a test program test_syscall.c:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define __NR_helloworld 335
int main( int argc , charargv[])
{
  syscall(__NR_helloworld);
  return 0;
}

The syscall number should match the syscall ID you used in the kernel.
Compile the program:
$ gcc test_syscall.c -o test_syscall
Test the new system call by running:
$ ./test_syscall

The test program will call the new system call and output a helloworld message at the tail of the output of
dmesg.

Assignment 2: Extend your new system call to print out the calling process‚Äôs
information (35 points)

Follow the instructions we discussed above and implement another system call print_self. This system
call identifies the calling process at the user-level and print out various information of the process.
Implement the print_self system call and print out the following information of the calling process:
 Process id, running state, and program name
 Start time and virtual runtime
 Its parent processes until init

HINT: The macro current returns a pointer to the task_struct of the current running process. See the
following link for more information:
http://linuxgazette.net/133/saha.html

Assignment 3: Extend your new system call to print out the information of an
arbitrary process identified by its PID(15 points)
Implement another system call print_other to print the information for an arbitrary process. The system
call takes a process pid as its argument and outputs the above information of this process.

HINT: 
You can start from the init process and iterate over all the processes. For each process, compare its
pid with the target pid. If there is a match, return the pointer to this task_struct.

A better approach is to use the pidhash table to look up the process in the process table. Linux provides
many functions to find a task by its pid.

Tips:
 The recent Linux requires much storage space after compilation. It is recommended that you at least
configure 35GB disk space for your VM.
 Configure 2-4 CPUs for your VM so as to use multiple CPUs for compilation. The first time compilation
of the Linux kernel takes 1-2 hours.
 Search ‚Äúhow to configure port forwarding‚Äù in VirtualBox to enable ssh remote login on your VM. The
remote login is much faster than using the console interface.
